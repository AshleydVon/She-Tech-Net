### Additional Libraries & Tools
- **GraphQL**: For efficient data querying and handling communication between the frontend and backend.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication.
- **Render**: For deployment, making the platform accessible online.
- **Testing Libraries**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
